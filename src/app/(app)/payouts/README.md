# Payout Processing System

## Overview

The Payout Processing System is a comprehensive solution for managing money transfer payouts in the Global Remit Teller application. It provides functionality for initiating, tracking, and reconciling payouts through various partners and delivery methods, ensuring efficient and reliable money delivery to recipients.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns, ensuring all files stay under 200 lines for maintainability. The architecture consists of:

### 1. Data Models

The system uses TypeScript interfaces to define the data models:

- **`Payout`**: Represents a payout transaction.
- **`PayoutPartner`**: Represents a payout partner.
- **`PayoutRequest`**: Represents a request to create a payout.
- **`PayoutUpdate`**: Represents an update to a payout.
- **`PayoutStatusUpdate`**: Represents a status update from a partner.
- **`PayoutReconciliation`**: Represents a reconciliation record.
- **`PayoutFeeCalculation`**: Represents the result of a fee calculation.

### 2. Service Layer

The service layer handles all business logic and API communication:

- **`payout-service.ts`**: Core service that manages payout operations and partner integrations.

### 3. State Management

The system uses Redux for state management:

- **`payout-slice.ts`**: Redux slice that manages payout state.
- **`usePayouts.ts`**: Custom hook that provides a unified interface to access payout functionality.

### 4. UI Components

The UI layer consists of modular components:

- **`PayoutPartnersList.tsx`**: Displays a list of payout partners with filtering.
- **`PayoutTransactionsList.tsx`**: Displays a list of payout transactions with filtering and sorting.
- **`PayoutDetails.tsx`**: Displays detailed information about a payout and allows status updates.

### 5. Pages

- **`payouts/page.tsx`**: Main page for managing payout operations.

## Core Features

### 1. Payout Partner Management

- **View Partners**: Display all available payout partners.
- **Filter Partners**: Filter partners by country, currency, method, and status.
- **Partner Details**: View detailed information about each partner.

### 2. Payout Transaction Management

- **View Transactions**: Display all payout transactions.
- **Filter Transactions**: Filter transactions by status, method, partner, and date range.
- **Sort Transactions**: Sort transactions by various fields.
- **Transaction Details**: View detailed information about each transaction.
- **Status Updates**: Update the status of payout transactions.

### 3. Multi-Method Support

The system supports multiple payout methods:

- **Bank Transfer**: Direct transfer to recipient's bank account.
- **Cash Pickup**: Recipient collects cash at a partner location.
- **Mobile Wallet**: Transfer to recipient's mobile wallet.
- **Home Delivery**: Cash delivered to recipient's address.
- **Debit Card**: Transfer to recipient's debit card.

### 4. Status Tracking

The system tracks the status of each payout:

- **Pending**: Payout has been created but not yet processed.
- **Processing**: Payout is being processed by the partner.
- **Completed**: Payout has been successfully delivered to the recipient.
- **Failed**: Payout has failed due to an error.
- **Cancelled**: Payout has been cancelled.

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User initiates a payout or views existing payouts.
2. **Hook Call**: Component calls the appropriate method from `usePayouts`.
3. **Redux Action**: Hook dispatches an action to the Redux store.
4. **Service Call**: Redux thunk calls the corresponding method in `payout-service.ts`.
5. **State Update**: Service returns the result, which updates the Redux state.
6. **UI Update**: Components re-render based on the updated state.

## State Structure

The Redux state for payouts has the following structure:

```typescript
interface PayoutState {
  payouts: Payout[];
  currentPayout: Payout | null;
  partners: PayoutPartner[];
  currentPartner: PayoutPartner | null;
  reconciliations: PayoutReconciliation[];
  currentReconciliation: PayoutReconciliation | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  lastUpdated: string | null;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Fetching Payout Partners

```tsx
const { loadAllPartners, partners, isLoading } = usePayouts();

// Load all partners
useEffect(() => {
  loadAllPartners();
}, [loadAllPartners]);

// Display partners
return (
  <div>
    {isLoading ? (
      <p>Loading partners...</p>
    ) : (
      <ul>
        {partners.map(partner => (
          <li key={partner.id}>{partner.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}
  </div>
);
```

### Creating a Payout

```tsx
const { initiatePayoutRequest } = usePayouts();

// Create a new payout
const handleCreatePayout = async () => {
  try {
    const payoutRequest = {
      transactionId: 'TRX-2025-123',
      partnerId: '1',
      senderId: 'S-001',
      receiverId: 'R-001',
      amount: 1000,
      currency: 'USD',
      method: PayoutMethod.BANK_TRANSFER,
      notes: 'Monthly family support'
    };
    
    await initiatePayoutRequest(payoutRequest, 'user-123');
    
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Updating Payout Status

```tsx
const { updatePayoutStatus } = usePayouts();

// Update payout status
const handleStatusUpdate = async (payoutId: string) => {
  try {
    const updateData = {
      status: PayoutStatus.COMPLETED,
      statusDetails: 'Funds successfully transferred to recipient',
      actualDeliveryDate: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    
    await updatePayoutStatus(payoutId, updateData, 'user-123');
    
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**: Prevent invalid payouts (e.g., missing required fields).
2. **Service Errors**: Handle API communication errors.
3. **State Errors**: Handle Redux state errors.

All errors are displayed to the user with clear, actionable messages.
