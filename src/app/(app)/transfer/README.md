# Money Transfer System

## Overview

The Money Transfer System is a comprehensive solution for handling remittance operations in the Global Remit Teller application. It provides a complete end-to-end flow for sending money, from sender and receiver selection to confirmation and receipt generation.

## Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clean separation of concerns, ensuring all files stay under 200 lines for maintainability. The architecture consists of:

### 1. Service Layer

The service layer handles all business logic and API communication:

- **`transaction-service.ts`**: Core service that manages transaction creation and processing.
- **`transfer-service.ts`**: Handles specific transfer-related operations.
- **`transfer-mock-service.ts`**: Provides mock data for development and testing.

### 2. Utility Layer

The utility layer provides helper functions:

- **`receipt-generator.ts`**: Generates PDF receipts for completed transfers.
- **`utils.ts`**: Contains utility functions for formatting and validation.

### 3. UI Components

The transfer flow is implemented as a multi-step process with modular components:

- **`TransferFlow.tsx`**: Main component that orchestrates the 5-step transfer process.
- **`SenderSelection.tsx`**: Step 1: Allows users to select a sender.
- **`ReceiverSelection.tsx`**: Step 2: Allows users to select a receiver.
- **`AmountEntry.tsx`**: Step 3: Allows users to enter transfer amount.
- **`TransferDetails.tsx`**: Step 4: Collects additional details for the transfer.
- **`TransferConfirmation.tsx`**: Step 5: Reviews and confirms the transfer.
- **`TransferReceipt.tsx`**: Displays and handles receipt generation for completed transfers.

### 4. Pages

- **`transfer/page.tsx`**: Main transfer page that integrates the TransferFlow component.
- **`transfer/history/page.tsx`**: Displays transfer history with filtering and sorting.

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User navigates through the 5-step transfer process.
2. **State Management**: Each step collects and validates data, passing it to the next step.
3. **Service Call**: On confirmation, the data is sent to the transaction service.
4. **Receipt Generation**: After successful transfer, a receipt is generated.
5. **History Update**: The transfer is added to the history for future reference.

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Step Transfer Process

The transfer process is divided into 5 steps:

1. **Sender Selection**: Select an existing sender or create a new one.
2. **Receiver Selection**: Select an existing receiver or create a new one.
3. **Amount Entry**: Enter the send amount, with real-time calculation of receive amount.
4. **Transfer Details**: Enter purpose, source of funds, payment method, and delivery method.
5. **Confirmation**: Review and confirm the transfer details.

### 2. Real-Time Currency Conversion

The system provides real-time currency conversion with:

- Exchange rate display
- Fee calculation
- Total cost calculation

### 3. Receipt Generation

After a successful transfer, the system generates a comprehensive receipt with:

- Transaction details
- Sender and receiver information
- Amount details
- Transfer purpose and method
- Reference number

The receipt can be printed, downloaded as PDF, emailed, or shared.

### 4. Transfer History

The system maintains a detailed history of all transfers with:

- Filtering by status (completed, pending, failed, cancelled)
- Searching by tracking number, sender, or receiver
- Sorting by date, amount, sender, or receiver
- Pagination for better performance with large datasets

## Data Models

### Transfer Data

```typescript
interface TransferData {
  senderId: string;
  receiverId: string;
  sendAmount: number;
  receiveAmount: number;
  sendCurrency: string;
  receiveCurrency: string;
  exchangeRate: number;
  fee: number;
  purpose: string;
  sourceOfFunds: string;
  paymentMethod: string;
  deliveryMethod: string;
  notes?: string;
  referenceNumber?: string;
}
```

### Transfer Response

```typescript
interface TransferResponse {
  transactionId: string;
  trackingNumber: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'failed';
  timestamp: string;
}
```

### Transfer History

```typescript
interface TransferHistory {
  id: string;
  senderId: string;
  senderName: string;
  receiverId: string;
  receiverName: string;
  sendAmount: number;
  receiveAmount: number;
  sendCurrency: string;
  receiveCurrency: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'failed' | 'cancelled';
  date: string;
  trackingNumber: string;
  purpose: string;
  paymentMethod: string;
  deliveryMethod: string;
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Transfer

```tsx
// In TransferConfirmation.tsx
const handleConfirm = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await transactionService.createTransaction({
      senderId: sender.id,
      receiverId: receiver.id,
      sendAmount: amount.sendAmount,
      receiveAmount: amount.receiveAmount,
      sendCurrency: amount.sendCurrency,
      receiveCurrency: amount.receiveCurrency,
      exchangeRate: amount.exchangeRate,
      fee: amount.fee,
      purpose: details.purpose,
      sourceOfFunds: details.sourceOfFunds,
      paymentMethod: details.paymentMethod,
      deliveryMethod: details.deliveryMethod,
      notes: details.notes,
      referenceNumber: details.referenceNumber
    });
    
    // Handle successful response
    setTransactionId(response.transactionId);
    setTrackingNumber(response.trackingNumber);
    setIsSuccess(true);
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

### Generating a Receipt

```tsx
// In TransferReceipt.tsx
const handleDownloadReceipt = () => {
  const receiptData: ReceiptData = {
    transactionId,
    trackingNumber,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    sender: {
      name: senderName,
      id: senderId
    },
    receiver: {
      name: receiverName,
      id: receiverId
    },
    amount: {
      sendAmount,
      receiveAmount,
      sendCurrency,
      receiveCurrency,
      exchangeRate,
      fee,
      totalCost
    },
    details: {
      purpose,
      sourceOfFunds,
      paymentMethod,
      deliveryMethod,
      notes,
      referenceNumber
    },
    status: 'completed'
  };
  
  generateAndDownloadReceipt(receiptData);
};
```

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**: Prevent invalid transfers (e.g., insufficient funds).
2. **Service Errors**: Handle API communication errors.
3. **Receipt Generation Errors**: Handle errors during PDF generation.

All errors are displayed to the user with clear, actionable messages.
