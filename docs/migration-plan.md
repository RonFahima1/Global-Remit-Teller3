## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Keep all files under 200 lines for maintainability
- Follow modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Organize components by feature rather than type

### State Management
- Use Redux for global state
- Use React Context for theme and auth
- Use local state for component-specific data
- Implement proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### API Integration
- Use React Query for data fetching where appropriate
- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript for type safety

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Follow iOS-inspired design aesthetic
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Radix UI for accessible components

## Migration Approach

### Feature-by-Feature Migration
Rather than migrating the entire codebase at once, we'll continue the feature-by-feature approach:

1. **Analyze Original Feature**: Study the Angular implementation to understand functionality
2. **Design Next.js Implementation**: Plan the architecture using Next.js best practices
3. **Implement Core Logic**: Build services and state management
4. **Create UI Components**: Develop the user interface components
5. **Test and Refine**: Ensure feature works as expected and integrates with existing components
6. **Document**: Update documentation with implementation details

### Parallel Development
For complex features, consider parallel development:

1. **Identify Independent Components**: Find components that can be developed in parallel
2. **Assign Resources**: Allocate development resources to different components
3. **Integration Points**: Define clear integration points and interfaces
4. **Regular Sync**: Ensure regular synchronization of parallel development efforts

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complex Feature Integration**
   - Risk: Difficulty integrating complex features with existing components
   - Mitigation: Define clear interfaces and integration points, use TypeScript for type safety

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Performance degradation with increasing application complexity
   - Mitigation: Regular performance testing, implement proper code splitting and optimization

3. **API Compatibility**
   - Risk: Differences in API requirements between Angular and Next.js
   - Mitigation: Create adapter layers where necessary, implement proper error handling

4. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Risk: Features taking longer than estimated
   - Mitigation: Build in buffer time, prioritize features, consider MVP approach for initial release

## Conclusion

This migration plan provides a structured approach to completing the transition from Angular to Next.js for the Global Remit Teller application. By following this plan, we can ensure that all critical features are implemented while maintaining code quality, performance, and user experience.

The feature-by-feature approach allows for incremental progress and reduces risk, while the phased implementation ensures that related features are developed together for better integration. Regular testing and documentation throughout the process will ensure a smooth transition and maintainable codebase.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 with the implementation of the Fee Structure Management system
2. Set up the project structure for the remaining features
3. Create a detailed timeline with specific tasks and assignments
4. Establish regular check-ins to track progress and address any issues
